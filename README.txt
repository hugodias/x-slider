Simple and lightweight slider for Wordpress

== Description ==
The most famous sliders are only based on images and titles, but in most cases we use these sliders to display the posts, and there lies the problem.
Most plugins makes it very difficult to connect a slider to a post, and this is wrong ! A blog is made of posts and everything should revolve around them.
I present to you the X- slider, a slider based on posts! No complicated interfaces and billions of options that do not even use .
The X-slider was created with the purpose of being simple, easy to use, easy to set up and of course, easy to change, because it was made for Developers.

1. Upload `x-slider` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

1. Click on \"Choose image\" and upload your image
