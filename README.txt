Simple, beautiful, responsive and lightweight slider that don't suck.

== Description ==
The most famous sliders are only based on images and titles, but in most cases we use these sliders to display the posts, and there lies the problem.

Most plugins makes it very difficult to connect a slider to a post, and this is wrong !

A blog is made of posts and everything should revolve around them.

I present to you the X- slider, a slider based on posts! No complicated interfaces and billions of options that do not even use.

The X-slider was created with the purpose of being simple, easy to use, easy to set up and of course, easy to change, because it was made for Developers.

**Features**

* Beautiful full width responsive image slider.
* Extreme simple and efficient user interface.
* All slides work based on Posts. You attach a slide directly inside the post editor.
* Super easy to customize, as a developer you'll love it.
* Super easy to add, change and remove the slides. The admin user will also love it.
