Simple, beautiful, responsive and lightweight slider that don't suck.

== Description ==
The most famous sliders are only based on images and titles, but in most cases we use these sliders to display the posts, and there lies the problem.

Most plugins makes it very difficult to connect a slider to a post, and this is wrong !

A blog is made of posts and everything should revolve around them.

I present to you the X- slider, a slider based on posts! No complicated interfaces and billions of options that do not even use.

The X-slider was created with the purpose of being simple, easy to use, easy to set up and of course, easy to change, because it was made for Developers.

* Extreme simple and efficient user interface.
* All slides work based on Posts. You attach a slide directly inside the post editor.
* Super easy to customize, as a developer you'll love it.
* Super easy to add, change and remove the slides. The admin user will also love it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install this plugin and getting it working on my theme? =
First of all you'll need yo install this plugin. Go to your plugins page on your Wordpress dashboard and search for X-slider.
After installing you just need to set it in your theme.
Open your favorite Text editor wherever you want to display it, for example, if you want to display on the top of every page,
open your header.php theme and inside the <body> tag, insert the following code:

`<?php x_slider(); ?>`

= How to filter posts showing on slider? =

You can use [WP_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query) syntax on X-slider, so let's say you want to only show slides for the "Featured" category,
you should write:

`<?php x_slider(array('category_name' => 'featured')); ?>`

= I want to change the order, how to do that? =

As already mentioned before, you can use [WP_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query) syntax for customizing your slider.
Ex: Show only posts from "Featured" category ordered by date limiting to 5 slides max

`<?php x_slider(array('category_name' => 'featured', 'orderby' => 'date', 'order' => 'DESC', posts_per_page => 5)); ?>`

= How to change the slider image dimensions? =

Accessing X_slider settings page right on the sidebar, click in "X-Slider Settings", on the "Slider Upload Options"
section you'll be able to change the width and height settings.

= How to change the slider timeout? =

On settings page :)

= This slider is too ugly, how to customize it? =

You can write your own CSS if you want to. The slider structure is very simple. Basically it's a div with the x-slider class ".x-slider"
with a UL and the slides are LI's with a container wrapping a title, description and a button.

= Can i have multiple sliders on the same page? =

Sure, just call `<?php x_slider(); ?>` as many times you want to.
